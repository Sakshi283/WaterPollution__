    <h1>Control of Water Pollution</h1><hr>
    <p><strong>It is easy to reduce water pollution from point sources by legislation.
    However,due to absence of defined strategies it becomes difficult to prevent water pollution from non-point sources.The following points may help in reducing water pollution from non-point sources.</strong></p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Judicious use of agrochemicals like pesticides and fertilizers which will reduce their surface run-off and leaching.Avoid use of these on sloped lands.</li>
<li>Use of nitrogen fixing plants to supplement the use of fertilizers.</li> 
<li>Adopting integrated pest management to reduce reliance on pesticides.</li>
<li>Prevent run-off of manure.Divert such run-off to basin for settlement.The nutrient rich water can be used as fertilizer in the fields.</li>
<li>Separate drainage of sewage and rain water should be provided to prevent overflow of sewage with rainwater.</li>
<li>Planting trees would reduce pollution by sediments and will also prevent soil erosion.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For controlling water pollution from point sources,treatment of wastewaters is essential before being discharged.Parameters which are considered for reduction in such water are:-</strong><br></p>
<ul type="square">
    <li>Total solids,biological oxygen demand(BOD),chemical oxygen demand(COD),nitrates and phosphates,oil and grease,toxic metals etc.</li>
    <li>Wastewaters should be properly treated by primary and secondary treatments to reduce the BOD,COD levels upto the permissible levels for discharge. </li>
    <li>Advanced treatment for removal of nitrates and phosphates will prevent eutrophication.Before the discharge of wastewater, it should be disinfected to kill the disease-causing organisms like bacteria.</li>
    <li>Proper chlorination should be done to prevent the formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons or disinfection should be done by ozone or ultraviolet radiations.</li>
</ul>
